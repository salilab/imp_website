IMP has been employed to translate tethered conformation capture (TCC) data
into physical chromatin contacts in a population of three-dimensional
genome structures. Statistical analysis of the resulting population
demonstrates that the indiscriminate properties of interchromosomal
interactions are consistent with the well-known architectural features of
the human genome.

IMP has been used by researchers at the Centro de Investigación Príncipe Felipe
in Spain, in combination with chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C)
technology, to generate high-resolution three-dimensional models of chromatin
at the megabase scale.
