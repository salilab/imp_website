<h2>Mailing lists</h2>
<p>We provide several mailing lists for discussion on using and
developing IMP.</p>

<p>The <a href="imp-users.html">imp-users</a>
mailing list is provided for users of IMP. It is for discussion of and
help with the use of IMP, as well as for discussion of the development of new
features in IMP, such as the design of new C++ or Python classes. Prior
postings are archived and can be searched. All users and developers of IMP
are encouraged to subscribe to this list.</p>

<p>The <a href="imp-build.html">imp-build</a>
list sends out an email every morning with the results of the nightly builds
of IMP. All developers are encouraged to subscribe to this list, so they can
be notified if they break the build.</p>

<p>The <a href="imp-commits.html">imp-commits</a>
list sends out an email every time code is changed in the IMP git repository.
It can be a high traffic list, and is only recommended for developers that
want to keep an eye on new developments.
(There are similar <a href="rmf-commits.html">RMF-commits</a> and
<a href="pmi-commits.html">PMI-commits</a>
lists for <a href="https://integrativemodeling.org/rmf/nightly/doc/">RMF</a>
and <a href="https://integrativemodeling.org/nightly/doc/ref/namespaceIMP_1_1pmi.html">PMI</a>
respectively.)</p>
