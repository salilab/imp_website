<h2>Mailing lists</h2>
<p>We provide several mailing lists for discussion on using and
developing IMP.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://salilab.org/mailman/listinfo/imp-users">imp-users</a>
mailing list is provided for <i>users</i> of IMP. It is for discussion of and
help with the use of IMP. Both users and developers are encouraged to subscribe
to the list. Prior postings are also
<a href="http://salilab.org/imp/archives/imp-users/">archived</a>
and <a href="search-imp-users.html">can be searched</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://salilab.org/mailman/listinfo/imp-dev">imp-dev</a>
mailing list is provided for <i>developers</i> of IMP. It is for technical
discussion of the development of new features in IMP, such as the design of
new C++ or Python classes. Developers are encouraged to subscribe, but regular
users are encouraged to use the
<a href="http://salilab.org/mailman/listinfo/imp-users">imp-users</a> list
instead. Prior postings are also
<a href="http://salilab.org/imp/archives/imp-dev/">archived</a>
and <a href="search-imp-dev.html">can be searched</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://salilab.org/mailman/listinfo/imp-build">imp-build</a>
list sends out an email every morning with the results of the nightly builds
of IMP. All developers are encouraged to subscribe to this list, so they can
be notified if they break the build. Developers that work only on a subset
of modules can choose to be notified only if one of those modules fails
(go to the <a href="http://salilab.org/mailman/listinfo/imp-build">imp-build</a>
page, select 'Unsubscribe or edit options', log in, then select one or more
modules, systems or applications from the topic filters.)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://salilab.org/mailman/listinfo/imp-commits">imp-commits</a>
list sends out an email every time code is changed in the IMP git repository.
It can be a high traffic list, and is only recommended for developers that
want to keep an eye on new developments.
(There are similar
<a href="http://salilab.org/mailman/listinfo/rmf-commits">RMF-commits</a>
and
<a href="http://salilab.org/mailman/listinfo/pmi-commits">PMI-commits</a>
lists for <a href="http://integrativemodeling.org/rmf/nightly/doc/">RMF</a>
and <a href="http://integrativemodeling.org/nightly/doc/ref/namespaceIMP_1_1pmi.html">PMI</a>
respectively.)</p>
