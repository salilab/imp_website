</p>

<h2>Signature</h2>

<p>Please check the installer package against the
<a href="http://salilab.org/imp/1.0/download/md5sum">MD5SUM</a> file
to make sure it has not been tampered with.
(One way to do this is to download the
<a href="http://www.colonywest.us/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=46&Itemid=56">digestIT</a>
software, right click on the IMP installer package, select "digestIT 2004",
then "Verify MD5 Hash" and paste in the line for the IMP .exe file from the
MD5SUM file.)</p>

<p>
The MD5SUM file in turn
<a href="http://salilab.org/imp/1.0/download/md5sum.asc">is signed</a> with
<a href="http://salilab.org/~ben/pubkey.asc">this GPG key</a>; you can check
to make sure this has also not been tampered with using the
<a href="http://www.gnupg.org/download/">GnuPG</a> software.
</p>

<h2>Installation and getting started</h2>

<p>The installer will install the IMP libraries and their Python interfaces
in a directory of your choosing on your Windows machine.</p>

<p>If you want to use the Python interface (e.g. if you want to run any
of the example Python scripts) you will need to install Python <b>2.6</b>
from <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.5/">the Python
website</a>. Note that no other version of Python will currently work with
this binary installer. One way to use an IMP Python script is to open it
in the Python 2.6 'IDLE' frontend and hit F5 to run it.</p>

<p>Note that the IMP Windows package does not currently include the
'foxs' command line tool for small angle X-ray (SAXS) fitting. This will be
remedied in a future IMP release.
For now, please <a href="http://salilab.org/foxs">use the web interface</a>,
install IMP on a Linux machine, or use a
<a href="http://salilab.org/imp/download.html#nightly">nightly build<a/>.</p>
