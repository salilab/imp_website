IMP's broad goal is to contribute to a comprehensive structural characterization of biomolecules ranging in size and complexity from small peptides to large macromolecular assemblies, by integrating data from diverse biochemical and biophysical experiments.
IMP provides an open source C++ and Python toolbox for solving complex
modeling problems, and a number of applications for tackling some common
problems in a user-friendly way. IMP can also be used from the 
<a href="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/">Chimera</a> molecular modeling
system, or via one of several web applications.

<b>Please note:</b> <i>While IMP currently supports both Python 2 and Python 3,
Python 2 was officially retired several years ago, and we plan to drop support
for Python 2 in the next IMP stable release after June 30th, 2024.
If this would cause a lot of issues with your own workflows and for some reason
you cannot move to Python 3, please <a href="contact.html">let us know</a> or update the relevant <a href="https://github.com/salilab/imp/issues/1092">GitHub issue</a></i>.
